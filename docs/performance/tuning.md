# Performance Tuning

The art of performance tuning can encompass the utilization and manipulation of
several different tools. However, some common axioms are true no matter where or
how tuning is being applied:

1. Tuning is most effective when done closest to where the work is performed.
1. Not all levels of tuning are appropriate for a given circumstance (in this
   regard, tuning is measued as a function of appropriateness).
1. Tuning is often only valid at a specific point in time.

Systems performance tuning often falls into two broad categories: *application*
and *hardware*. The largest performance wins often happen when tuning the
application level; however, these wins are often only gained after a thorough
inspection of the hardware reveals where application tuning is needed.
