# LAN

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network which includes all devices in the same
broadcast domain. It typically consists of various switches, router interfaces,
and Network Interface Cards (NICs).

A LAN is limited by the the radius of a broadcast frame. Meaning, should an
Ethernet broadcast frame enter the network at any point, any devices which
receieve the forwarded frame is considered within the broadcast domain, or LAN.
