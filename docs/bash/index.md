# Bash

This section of the handbook covers all things bash. I find myself writing bash
scripts on an infrequent enough basis that I can never recall all the odd bits
that are necessary for writing a reliable script. This section isn't intended to
be a complete tutoral, but rather a reference to trigger enough neurons in my
brain to recall what's needed.
